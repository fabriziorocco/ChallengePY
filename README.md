## About

During the last years the car transport industry has been changing relevantly, especially since the introduction of innovative services that allowed cars to be connected to the internet, opening an entire scenario of tech possibilities for cars. Moreover, artificial intelligence has started to play a role in the aforesaid industry thanks to the loads of data collected that are used to build algorithms that assist the driver and monitor the specifics of the vehicle. Nonetheless, the most striking services offered regard personalization (both of the vehicle and of the insurance and warranty plans) and maintenance, since it is optimized by artificial intelligence and by customized services that aim to allow the customer to save time (e.g. pick up and delivery service, which basically consist in scheduled maintenance performed entirely by the car dealer without the need to even take the car to the repair shop and back personally).
Car dealers are in fact starting to focus more on the personalized services to offer to their customers and of course on how to advertise them properly, since they have the compelling need to build brand loyalty in their customers and to attract new customers without focusing on the product per se.
